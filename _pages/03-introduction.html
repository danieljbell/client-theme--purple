    <h1><strong>An Introduction</strong> to purple</h1>
    <p>Purple was founded like many a great company, through frustration with a service, product or unfulfilled need… in our case it was Public WiFi. We found that public WiFi lacked a positive user experience in every element from design and login methods, to the simplest of features, like responsiveness across varying devices.</p>
    <p>Purple quickly realised that not only was public WiFi broken for users, it was adding little value for those who provided the service too.</p>
    <p>We decided that didn’t make sense; Purple’s been changing public WiFi one access point at a time ever since. We’ve now grown into a global company with deployments in over 70 countries, and partners ranging from small local IT companies through to big brand Telco’s all over the world.</p>
    <p>With nearly eight million users and customers in over 70 countries, Purple works with a range of brands and venues, including Molson Coors, Legoland, Jaguar, United Wireless Arena, City of York and TUI. We have a global agreement in place with Westcon Comstor, in addition to an active reseller base of over 728 in 80 countries. We employ over 70 full time staff and currently have offices in the UK, US, Madrid, Melbourne and Singapore with more offices planned.</p>
