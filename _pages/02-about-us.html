    <p>Our digital world is saturated with analytics and tools to better understand and engage with users. The physical world however, has always been a poor relation by comparison. Thatâ€™s no longer the case.</p>
    <p>By using WiFi as a foundation and layering on other available data sources, physical spaces can now be understood in the same way as a website. This is a game changing point in time. We are now able to provide hyper-personalised, location based, relevant and timely interactions with customers.</p>
    <p>As we move into the era of the Internet of Things, I believe the richness of what we can do in physical spaces will change our world forever.</p>
